Because the repo is large, we recommend you to download directly the latest version only and ignore (or delete)  the following details of the subdirectory of
interest:

```
SUBDIR=foo
svn export https://github.com/google-research/google-research/trunk/$SUBDIR
```

If you'd like to submit a pull request, you'll need to delete the clone repository;
we recommend directly to download a latest version  of Google search instead of vshallow clone (without history and deleted).
